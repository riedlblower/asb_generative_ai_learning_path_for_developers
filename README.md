## Learning Plan: Generative AI Learning Path for Developers (free course)

Python Scripts dealing with the examples given in this course.

I ran these on a Windows Command Prompt after successful access to AWS via "aws configure sso.

## Prerequistes : python3 is installed.

### Unique Selling Point: SageMaker is not involved i.e. AWS costs are reduced.

Note the earlier python scripts use Amazon Titan which is rather inexpensive while later python scripts use Anthropic Claude which is more expensive but far more accurate at the time of writing.
