## Learning Plan: Generative AI Learning Path for Developers (free course)

Python Scripts dealing with the examples given in this course.

I ran these on a Windows Command Prompt after successful access to AWS via "aws configure sso.

## Prerequistes : 	python3 is installed.
##					CLI access to AWS and the Amazon Bedrock Service
##					Access to Anthropic Claude (for later python scripts)

### Unique Selling Point: SageMaker is not involved i.e. AWS costs are reduced.

As mentioned above the earlier python scripts use the Amazon Titan Foundation Model which is rather inexpensive while later python scripts use Anthropic Claude which is more expensive but far more accurate at the time of writing. Access to Anthropic Claude must be requested from within Amazon Bedrock while access to Amazon Titan is allowed by default.
